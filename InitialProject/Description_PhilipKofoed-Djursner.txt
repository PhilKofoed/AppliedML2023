1. Classification_PhilipKofoed-Djursner_lightgbm.txt:
	Algorithm: Lightgbm LGBMClassifier
	Key HP values: min_child_samples=333, num_leaves=88
	HP optimisation: Used BayesianOptimization which optimized the cross validation score based on "roc_auc" over 5 cross validations
	Parameters in model: didn't know how to measure
 	Loss function and value on validation set: -0.198 (neg log loss with 5-fold cross validation)
 	Own evaluation: Good model, variable choice optimised with feature importance over three runs 165 to 60, 60 to 35, and 35 to 15. To give information which was cshared between variables an opportunity to present itself

2. Regression_PhilipKofoed-Djursner_lightgbm.txt:
	Algorithm: Lightgbm LGBMRegressor
	Key HP values: min_child_samples=30, num_leaves=34
	HP optimisation: Used BayesianOptimization which optimized the cross validation score based on "neg_mean_absolute_error" over 5 cross validations
	Parameters in model: didn't know how to measure
 	Loss function and value on validation set: -6113 (neg mean absolute loss with 5-fold cross validation)
 	Own evaluation: Good model, variable choice optimised with feature importance.

3. Clustering_PhilipKofoed-Djursner_DBSCAN.txt:
	Algorithm: SKlearn DBSCAN
	Key HP values: eps=0.5
	HP optimisation: Tried saome differnet HPs
	Parameters in model: didn't know how to measure
 	Loss function and value on validation set: no test done
 	Own evaluation: Useless model
